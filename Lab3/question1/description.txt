p1 is of type PersonWithJob and p2 is of type Person.
we notice that line 
    if (!(aPerson instanceof PersonWithJob)) return false;
checks if p2 (of type Person) is an instance of PersonWithJob. 
This returns false because p2 is not a PersonWithJob.
As a result, p1.equals(p2) evaluates to false.

another way 
p2 is of type Person and p1 is of type PersonWithJob.
we observed this line 
    if (!(aPerson instanceof Person)) return false;
checks if p1 (of type PersonWithJob) is an instance of Person. 
This returns true because PersonWithJob is a subclass of Person.
