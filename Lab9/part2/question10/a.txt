IntStream.generate(() -> 1)  generates an infinite stream of 1s. The lambda () -> 1 always returns the value 1.

distinct() operation attempts to remove duplicate elements in the stream. Since the stream only contains the value 1, 
all elements after the first will be considered duplicates.

forEach(System.out::println) tries to consume the stream and print each distinct element. Since thereâ€™s only one unique value (1), it will print 1.


The problem is the code will hang because of gnerate() produces an infinte stream


##Fix by add limit operation

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntStream ones = IntStream.generate(() -> 1).limit(10).distinct();
        ones.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
